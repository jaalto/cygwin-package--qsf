sdesc: "Lightweight statistical spam filter"
ldesc: "Quick Spam Filter is a lightweight statistical spam filter. It
is designed to be small, fast, reliable, easy to install, and simple
to use in a procmail recipe. For these reasons it is not written in
Perl (slow to start up) and does not run as a daemon handling requests
(more complex, harder to install and use)."
